<h2>Overview</h2>

ARCowboid is an augmented reality application created using TIARX. TIARX provides an estimate the current camera pose computed by the CameraPoseEngine which internally relies on libARTI for feature tracking.

The camera pose obtained by TIARX is used to control a virtual camera in a simple openGL scene which draws Android on top of the camera stream. As the camera is moved, the Textured cube object will move accordingly.

<h2>Overview</h2>

ARXStreams is a basic application showing 3 simultaenous streams - A high res camera preview, a low res camera preview and a Sobel 3X3 post processed image stream.

Each stream uses different means of getting the data displayed, 
1. The high resolution preview uses a SurfaceView which can be registered with the ARX API.
2. The lower resolution image uses a SurfaceTexture and its displayed through a TextureView.
3. The third uses a Bitmap which is manually filled when receiving a callback from the ARX framework. This bitmap feed an ImageView for display into the screen.
