/*! \page page_memory Memory Allocation And Usage

DVP allows the programmer to allocate memory in many formats, depending on
the local HLOS. When DVP is running on a system with a TILER, DVP can
allocate 1D cached and 1D uncached and 2D uncached tiled memory. Normally
most allocations are allocated via malloc, calloc or memalign. The RPC layer
of DVP understands the Cache issues associated with remote core execution and
works to keep buffers consistent after Section executions.

\section sec_supported_memory Supported Memory Types

DVP supports multiple memory types for Images and Buffers.
Plain Virtual Memory
- 1D TILER Cached Memory
- 1D TILER Uncached Memory
- 2D TILER Uncached Memory
- Diplay Buffers (2D TILER Uncached) Memory

On systems where the TILER API is exposed to DVP directly it will use it to
allocate 1D/2D memory. On Host systems, only plain virtual memory is supported.

To specify the desired memory allocation, you provide the \ref DVP_MemType_e
along with the \ref DVP_Image_Alloc function.

\code

DVP_Image_t image;

DVP_Image_Init(&image, 640, 480, FOURCC_UYVY);
DVP_Image_Alloc(hDVP, &image, DVP_MTYPE_MPUCACHED_1DTILED);

\endcode
