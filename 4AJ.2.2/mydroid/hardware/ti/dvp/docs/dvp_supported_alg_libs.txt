/*! \page supported_algorithms Supported Algorithm Libraries

Following algorithms are largely from the Machine Vision Algorithms. Currently DVP has several
TI proprietary algorithm kernels which it uses.

- VLIB (Vision Library) - a collection of computer vision kernels that have been developed by and optimized for TI's media processors.
- RVM  (Rear View Module) - Homography Transforms.
- TISMO (TI Stereo Module) - a method to generate a depth map from 2 simple cameras.
- IMGLIB (Image Library) - a collection of more than 70 image processing kernels
optimized for TI's DSP that can be used for image and video processing applications. The rich set of software routines
included in IMGLIB perform image processing functionalities including compression/decompression, image analysis, image filtering, and format
conversion.
- VRUN (Video/Image Coproc)- a subset of VLIB and IMGLIB ported to iMX.
- ORB - an efficient alternative to SIFT or SURF based on BRIEF and FAST.

DVP also has some algorithm kernels which will be released "openly" with DVP.
- \subpage page_yuv - a set of NEON accelerated image processing functions.
- \subpage page_imgfilter - a 3x3 image convolution library written in NEON.
- \subpage page_ocl - a set of OpenCL kernels which implement a 3x3 image convolution. (Only
available on OpenCL enabled platforms).
