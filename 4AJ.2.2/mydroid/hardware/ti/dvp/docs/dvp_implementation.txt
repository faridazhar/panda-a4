\page page_implementation Implementation Details

\section languages Languages

DVP is implemented in C with some C99 extensions. GCC and Microsoft's CL
compiler can both compile the majority of DVP. DVP does contain some NEON ARM
assembly (see Writing ARM Assembly) which is in the AT&T assembly style.

DVP contains other components which are implemented in C++ (VisionCam/
VisionEngine). These are convenience classes used to simplify usage of DVP
within a HLOS environment.

\section supported_hlos Supported HLOS

- Froyo, Gingerbread, IceCreamSandwich Android - using Android makefiles.
- QNX - using Concerto
- Ubuntu Linux - "Host" Build where the reference "C" versions of the kernels
are used. Using Concerto build.
- Windows NT - "Host" Build where the reference "C" versions of the kernels are
used. Using Concerto build.

\section android_specific Android Specific Issues

-# Android Froyo/Gingerbread/ICS do not support a generic shmget (shared memory
allocation) and thus a "work-around" was used which allows multiple DVP
clients to allocate from a shared memory area via a native system service, "
shm_service" which is implemented in the SOSAL.
-# Android does not allow access to the OMX-CAMERA unless you are a "root"
privileged process (due to the need to read DCC files which are marked as
root privilege).
-# Once you access the OMX-CAMERA in root mode, you need a Binder interface for
callers to use to access your Daemon's features.
