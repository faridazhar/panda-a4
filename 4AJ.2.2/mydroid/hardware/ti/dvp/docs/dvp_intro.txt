\page page_introduction Introduction

 Distributed Vision Processing (DVP) is a framework developed by Texas Instruments that provides an API for
 clients to construct and call processing graphs of supported low-level vision and imaging functions.
 These functions (better known as kernels) are processed using optimized libraries on one of the SoC's supported
 cores.  On OMAP4, DVP can process libraries on the SIMCOP, DSP, or Cortex A9/Neon.
